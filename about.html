        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is ClearlyOpaque, and I like computers.<br><br> I've learned programming by myself since school stopped teaching interesting shit after a while. I enjoy systems programming and embedded programming. Lately, I've been experimenting with WebGPU and Rust just for fun. I also love penguins (Linux, btw).
